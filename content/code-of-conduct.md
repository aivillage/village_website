All delegates, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at AI Village are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.

# THE SHORT VERSION
AI Village is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any AI Village venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. 

Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the village at the discretion of the village organizers. Any violation of the [DEF CON code of conduct](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-code-of-conduct.html) will also result in immediate expulsion from the village and the conference at the discretion of the village and conference organizers.

# THE FULL VERSION
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the village organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or immediate expulsion from the village.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact village staff immediately.

Village staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the village. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all village venues and village-related social events.
